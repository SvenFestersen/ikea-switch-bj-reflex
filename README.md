# Mount IKEA Tr√•dfri E1743 in Busch-Jaeger Reflex SI frames
This repository contains the necessary files to 3d-print a mounting
frame that allows hiding [IKEA E1743 switches](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/tradfri-kabelloser-dimmer-weiss-70408595/)
behind standard flush-mounted Busch-Jaeger Reflex SI switch covers and frames.
This allows neat integration of IKEA smarthome components into existing
installation.

Note: I have no affiliation to IKEA or Busch-Jaeger. This is a hobby project.

What you need:
* one [IKEA E1743 switch](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/tradfri-kabelloser-dimmer-weiss-70408595/)
* a 3d printer
* one Busch-Jaeger Reflex SI switch cover
* one Busch-Jaeger Reflex SI frame with the appropriate size for your scenario
* 4x M3x5mm screws
* 4x M3 low profile hex nuts

The size of the Reflex frame you choose depends only on how you plan to integrate the
switch into your existing installation: a single frame can be used to build
a remote switch that can be stuck to the wall with double-sided tape
independent of existing switches or outlets. To mount the IKEA switch in a
group with existing switches or outlets, simply choose a frame one size larger
than the existing frame and mount the switch in the additional cut-out before
mounting the frame to the wall.

Instructions:
1. 3-d print the three STL files.
2. Remove all the plastic protusions from the back of the switch cover.
   This requires some force. Make the back as plane as possible.
3. Remove the screw and the back cover from the IKEA switch. Use a screw driver
   to remove the rocking cover.
4. Place the printed backplate behind the Reflex frame, place the hex nuts in
   the holes on the back.
5. Place the frontplate at the opposite side of teh frame in such a way that the
   screw holes align. Use the four screws to fasten it to the back plate.
6. Insert the ikea switch into the assembly. Make sue that it is oriented such that
   the screw hole in the switch matches the screw hole on the back plate. This may
   require some force. You may fix the switch from the back with the original screw.
   Do not do this if you want to be able to change the battery when the switch is
   mounted to the wall.
7. Place the last 3d-printed part in the switch cover and snap it to the previously
   assembled parts.

If you do not have the M3 screws and nuts, you can also glue the parts together.
This would of course prevent disassembling the whole thing in the future.
